         <p>"Until writing was invented, man lived in acoustic
            space: boundless, directionless, horizonless, in the
            dark of the mind, in the world of emotion, by
            primordial intuition, by terror. Speech is a social
            chart of this bog.
            The goose quill put an end to talk. It abolished
            mystery; it gave architecture and towns; it brought
            roads and armies, bureaucracy. It was the basic
            metaphor with which the cycle of civilization began, the step from the dark into the light of the
            mind. The hand that filled the parchment page
            built a city."</p>
